Grocery Sales Forecasting
Abstract

Product sales forecasting plays a pivotal role in effective inventory management, particularly in industries like Supermarkets and Grocery Stores. Accurately predicting future demand for goods is a constant challenge. Inadequate stock levels can lead to customer dissatisfaction, while overstocking ties up capital and storage space. This project explores the application of machine learning algorithms to enhance sales forecasting accuracy in the grocery retail sector.
Introduction

In this project, we aim to forecast product sales based on various factors, including item attributes, store data, transaction history, and external variables such as holidays and oil prices. Our work is inspired by the Kaggle Competition titled "Corporaci√≥n Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting," which presents the task of optimizing product stocking in grocery stores to ensure customers find the right products at the right time.
Problem Statement

The challenge at hand is approached as a supervised learning problem. We seek to predict sales by comparing the performance of different regression models. The models under consideration include:

    Linear Regression
    Decision Tree Regression
    ExtraTreeRegressor
    Gradient Boosting
    Random Forest Regression
    XGBoost

To further optimize our forecasting results, we explore the application of:

    Multilayer Perceptron (MLP): A class of feed-forward artificial neural networks.
    LightGBM: A gradient boosting framework employing tree-based learning algorithms.

The goal is to develop a robust and accurate forecasting model that can enhance product availability in stores, ensuring that they stock just the right amount of products at the right time.

Note: This project is for research and educational purposes and is not intended to replace current forecasting methods. It serves as a model-based exploration of sales forecasting using various machine learning techniques.
